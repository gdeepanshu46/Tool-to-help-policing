We used OpenCV in Deep Learning to detect "Vehicle Plates".

Technologies used :-

Back End - OpenCV in Deep Learning

Front End - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database - Google Firebase

API's - Reverse Geocoding API

How does it works :-

1. DL algorithm applied on videos containing vehicles from Surveillance Cameras.

2. It fetched Vehicle Number, and inserted Vehicle Number along with Date, Time, Latitude and Longitude of the place vehicle recorded at the camera, into Firebase.

3. User can put desired Vehicle Number in the hosted site and it would return the last located position, along with time and date, of the vehicle into the Map.
