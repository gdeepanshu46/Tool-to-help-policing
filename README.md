# Automatic Vehicle Plate Recognition

## Introduction

The project was developed under the "Gurugram Police Cyber Securtiy Summer Internship 2020" under the guidance of Mr. Rakshit Tandon (Cyber Security Expert).
The aim was to develop a tool to help in policing. It is a Vehicle Tracking Web App for the Authorities.

## Technologies used

  * Back End - OpenCV in Deep Learning
  
  * Front End - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  * Database - Google Firebase

  * API's - Reverse Geocoding API

## Working of Model

  1. DL algorithm applied on videos containing vehicles from Surveillance Cameras.

  2. It fetched Vehicle Number, and inserted Vehicle Number along with Date, Time, Latitude and Longitude of the place vehicle recorded at the camera, into Firebase.

  3. User can put desired Vehicle Number in the hosted site and it would return the last located position, along with time and date, of the vehicle into the Map.
